This course is about the fundamentals and advanced applications of artificial intelligence and deep learning. Artificial intelligence is the study of computers to simulate human thought processes and recognition processes (e.g., learning, inferencing, thinking, planning, etc.), and deep learning is the most effective way to achieve artificial intelligence today. The first half of this course covers the basics and applications of AI and deep learning, followed by an in-depth discussion focusing on applications of AI in segmentation, detection, geometric estimation, and reinforcement learning.
